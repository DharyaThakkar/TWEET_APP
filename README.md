My First Fullstack Project.

This is an complete Fullstack project build by me using the Django Framework. it is an Normal Tweet App with CRUD functionalities allowing users to create tweets, edit their existing tweets, remove and upload their tweets. I have used here Djnago's in-built login form for designing the login portal for the users and has used Django's built-in features for security like CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection, for validating the details entered by the user's are valid or not using the built-in is_valid() function etc.I have also used Djano's Jinja's template engine for following modularity of my code.

Technologies used :-
for Frontend :- HTML,Bootstrap(version 5.3.3)
for Backend :- Django(version 5.1.4), sqllite3
